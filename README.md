# Appeal to ham radio amateur!

Dear radio enthusiasts,

The Russian Federation has started an [attack](https://uacrisis.org/en/voienni-zlochyny-rf-en) on Ukraine, thereby declaring war on the entire civilized world. They are bombing of Ukrainian Hospitals, which directly violates Geneva Conventions. Military forces are killing civilians, destroying infrastructures.

Mariupol, which  is a city with the population of more than 400k people in the East part of Ukraine, is [under siege](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60601235). People are being completely cut off. They don't have electricity, heating, natural gas and water. No medicine, no food.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi  is the  number one [target](https://www.wsj.com/articles/once-a-comic-ukrainian-president-transforms-into-wartime-leader-11645794378), his family is target number two for the infiltration killing team. President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin [threatens](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-17/putin-is-likely-to-make-nuclear-threats-if-war-drags-u-s-says) the world with nuclear weapons. Total propaganda and information vacuum lead to support for the blood fascist regime.

Despite this, Russian trucks freely deliver goods to the terrorist state. From the received intercepts of radio conversations between car drivers, we can claim  that they support the regime. Because of the lack of knowledge, lack of information, lack of education.

Let us help them to understand and to show what horrible things their state is doing.

For this  we are asking you to monitor the CB band. Russian truckers are using **channel №15 freq. 27.130 AM** to communicate between themselves. Please try to recognize **Russian speech**. In case you find  an activity, you can transmit one of the following messages which  can be  found in this [repository](https://github.com/cbactivist/inform_ru_truckers/tree/main/audio). Please don’t do it too frequently. We need them to stay on the frequency and not migrate to the Internet :).
 
The main goal of the messages is to show them the truth.

Please inform us about your achievements. You can record a small video or audio with your transmission and make a post in social media with tag [#inform_ru_truckers](#inform_ru_truckers)      

Together we are struggling for a new better world.
